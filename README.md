# 30 Days Data Analytics & Data Science Roadmap

A 30-day roadmap to revise and strengthen my Data Analytics and Data Science fundamentals.  
This repository includes daily exercises, mini-projects, and notes covering:

- 🐍 Python (basics to intermediate)
- 📊 Excel (data cleaning and analysis)
- 🛢 MySQL (basics to advanced)
- 📈 Power BI (data visualization and reporting)
- 🐼 Pandas (data manipulation)
- 📉 Matplotlib & Seaborn (data visualization)
- 🤖 Scikit-learn (machine learning basics)

## 🎓 The Goal of This Roadmap

Regular practice and review are key to mastering data skills.  
This plan helps me revisit essential concepts and tools—from Python to ML—so I can build confidence and excel in data projects.

- Revise Python, SQL, and Excel.
- Practice data visualization with Power BI, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- Strengthen data manipulation with Pandas.
- Build a solid foundation in Scikit-learn for machine learning.

## 🏆 Final Step: Capstone Project

After completing the 30-day roadmap, I will work on an **end-to-end capstone project** to apply everything I've learned.  
This project will include:

- Data collection and cleaning  
- Data analysis with Python, Pandas, and SQL  
- Data visualization using Power BI, Matplotlib, and Seaborn  
- Building and evaluating machine learning models with Scikit-learn  
- Presenting actionable insights in a clear and professional report
